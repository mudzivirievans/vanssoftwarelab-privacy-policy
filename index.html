        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 18/03/2025</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>When you interact with the WhatsApp chatbot, we collect the following information:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Phone Number</strong>: The phone number you use to communicate with the chatbot.</li>
            <li><strong>Message Content</strong>: The text of the messages you send to the chatbot, which may include
                inquiries about our services, such as pricing and availability.</li>
        </ul>
        We do <strong>not</strong> ask for or collect any additional personal information (like your name or email
        address) unless you explicitly provide it in your message.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information collected to:
        <ul>
            <li>Respond to your inquiries about our services (such as software development, mobile app development, IT
                support, cloud computing, and more).</li>
            <li>Provide you with relevant information about our business offerings (like pricing and service details).
            </li>
            <li>Improve the chatbot’s ability to respond accurately using OpenAI’s API.</li>
        </ul>
        Your messages may be processed by OpenAI’s API to generate meaningful responses based on your queries. OpenAI
        uses these messages solely to provide relevant answers but does not retain any personal information beyond the
        interaction with the chatbot.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">3. Data Sharing and Third-Party Providers</h2>
        <p>We do not share your personal information with third parties unless required by law. However, we use
            third-party service providers to facilitate the chatbot:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>OpenAI</strong>: The chatbot uses OpenAI’s API to generate responses to your queries. OpenAI
                processes the text of your messages but does not retain or use your personal information beyond the
                interaction with the chatbot.</li>
            <li><strong>WhatsApp Business API</strong>: Your phone number is handled by WhatsApp’s platform for
                communication purposes, and no additional personal data is collected beyond your phone number and
                messages.</li>
        </ul>
        By interacting with the chatbot, you consent to the use of these third-party services for processing your data.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">4. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Your personal data is retained temporarily to provide a response and is not stored long-term. Once the
            communication session ends, the data is no longer actively stored by us. However, logs or records may be
            retained for security and auditing purposes, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable precautions to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or
            disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and
            we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <p>You have the right to:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access</strong>: Request access to any data we have about you (such as your phone number).</li>
            <li><strong>Correction</strong>: Request that we update or correct your personal information if it is
                inaccurate.</li>
            <li><strong>Deletion</strong>: Request the deletion of your personal data, subject to our legal obligations
                to retain certain information.</li>
        </ul>

            effective date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
